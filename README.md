** ** Main Features ** **

- ðŸ‘€ server will not send a msg to your terminal since your msg alredy lingers there (coolest part of the project imo ðŸ‘€ )
- when connected you need to assign a display name
  
- prefix for whisper msgs "@" like slack or discord mentions
- updates /list on every entry or disconnect
- error msgs

** Commands **
- /list - lists all connected users
- /w - whispers user from /list (needs to be connected)
- /quit - quits

- thinking of expanding this idea in JS aswell
